The events of October 7th took many of us by surprise. Ten million Israelis awoke to a starkly altered reality. A daily challenge we now face is locating the nearest shelter when the sirens soundâ€”a task made daunting by the critical element of time.

For instance, in Tel Aviv, the warning time is a mere 90 seconds.

 This urgency often leads to panic, and sadly, to injuries while people rush to find safety. At IsraShell, we've crafted an elegant solution to this problem. And in true Israeli spirit, we aim to make the situation not just bearable but 'Sababa'.

 steps:

 1. extracting data from google maps:
  we extracted all locations in israel under the name "bomb shelter" (or similar meaning), using a bit python for this.
